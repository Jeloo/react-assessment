      <p>
        This is to assess your ability to design and build React components.
        Assume that you are part of a team starting a new project, a consistent
        design language has been set by the Design Team, i.e. fonts, labels,
        button and input styles etc. Below are designs for some components for
        you to build. With unit tests and without 3rd party modal packages,
        build the modals shown in these designs and have re-usability in mind as
        what you build might be re-usable in other parts of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Include unit tests. React Testing Library is already 
          configured for you in the skeleton project.`}
      </p>
      Expected:
      <StyledList type="1">
        <li>
          <strong>No </strong>
          backdrop/page overlay is required for this exercise.
        </li>
        <li>
          All modals should expose a mechanism to allow them to be closed.
        </li>
        <li>
          There should be a way to consume button click events on modals with
          buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a demo page with three buttons that trigger each of the modals
          to show.
        </li>
      </StyledList>
      <DesignList>
        {modals.map(({ title, alt, src }, index) => (
          <div key={index.toString()}>
            <label htmlFor={`img-${index}`}>{title}</label>
            <img alt={alt} src={src} id={`img-${index}`} />
          </div>
        ))}
      </DesignList>
    </Content>
